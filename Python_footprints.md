## Due to Python's portability it can run on any operating system unless no system-dependent feature in our python code let's see the fascinating areas python shines.

<br>


> **Web Development**


+ Django, Pyramid, Flask, Bottle

+ These are the frameworks that are packed with std libraries and modules which simplifies tasks like content management, database interaction and interfacing with internet protocols like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON, FTP, IMAP and POP

<br>

> **Game Development**


+ Libraries like PySoy, PyGame.

+ Python is the foundation for popular games like Battlefield 2, Frets on Fire, World of Tanks, Disney's Toontown online, Vega Strike and Civilization-IV. 
Python is used as a scripting language by many game engines.

<br>

> **Scientific and Numeric Applications**


+ Python plays major role here and it has massive loaded libraries to deal with.
Application like Free-CAD (3D Modeling software) and Abaqus (Finite Element method software) are coded in Python.

+ Most famous packages are 
    + Scipy (scientific numeric library)
    + Pandas (data analytic library)
    + IPython (command shell)
    + Numeric Python (fundamental numeric package i.e numpy)
    + NLTK (Mathematical and Text analysis)

<br>

> **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**


+ I dont want to say anything new as you all know that this is the emergening global technology and top search topic all time in google.

+ Apart from Scipy, Pandas and Numpy these are the additional modules will be used

    + Seaborn, Tableau, Plotly, Matplotlib, Bokeh for data visualization
    + Kera, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Caffee, PyTorch, Accord.NET for AI and ML

<br>

> **Desktop GUI**


+ Python offers many toolkits and frameworks for desktop application development

    + PyQt, PyGtk, Kicy, Tkinter, WxPython, PyGUI and PySide

<br>

> **Software Development**


+ Python also be used for build control, testing and management.

    + SCons is designed explicitly for build control
    + Buildbot and Apache Gump allow for automated continuous application testing
    + Roundup and Trac are great for bug tracking and Project Managment

<br>

> **Enterprise-Level Business Aplications**


+ Odoo, an all-in-one management software
+ Tryton, a three-tier general purpose application platform
