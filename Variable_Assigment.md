**Python variables work as pointers to objects.**

   - i.e  they aren't restricted to a specific type and can be assigned dynamically. (duck typing)
   - variables are not declared its assigned
   - in short think of a variable as a name for an object.


**Rules**

   - can consist of upper and lowercase letter, the digits 0-9 and the underscore character.
   - the first character of a variable cannot be a digit
   - reserved keywords should not be used as variable names.
   - are case-sensitive


**Conventions as Defined in PEP8**

   - use snake_case for variable names (instead of CamelCase)
   - Don't use names that look like the digits 1 and 0 example lowercase L
   - Snake case should be used for functions and variable names
   - Pascal case should be used for class names 
   - Camel Case - Not recommended but no harm in using it
   - _age is private variable within the function scope
   - \__age__ ("double underscore"), this a name mangling used generally as class instances
